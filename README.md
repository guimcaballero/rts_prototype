# Bevy RTS Prototype

This is an early stage prototype for an RTS game made with the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. Read a bit about it [here](https://caballerocoll.com/blog/bevy-rts-prototype).

At the moment a simple movement system for the camera and units has been implemented, and not much else. Oh, and units are just cubes.

It uses [bevy_mod_picking](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking/) to deal with selecting units and their target position.

## Gameplay

Here's a gif showcasing most the features:
